# üåê **Creating and Deploying the GlobalNames Zone in Windows Server**

The **GlobalNames zone** is a specialized DNS zone that allows for **single-label name resolution** without relying on WINS (Windows Internet Name Service). It‚Äôs especially useful when migrating from WINS to DNS or when you need to support single-label names for static, globally important servers (like file and web servers).

Let's walk through **three methods** for creating and deploying the GlobalNames zone: using the Windows interface, command line, and PowerShell.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Creating the GlobalNames Zone Using the Windows Interface** üñ•Ô∏è

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Open DNS Manager**:

   * Click **Start** ‚Üí **Administrative Tools** ‚Üí **DNS**.

2. **Launch the New Zone Wizard**:

   * In the **console tree**, right-click the DNS server and select **New Zone** to open the **New Zone Wizard**.

3. **Welcome Page**:

   * Click **Next** to proceed.

4. **Zone Type**:

   * Select **Primary Zone** and check **Store the zone in Active Directory** (this option is only available if the DNS server is a writable domain controller).
   * Click **Next**.

5. **Zone Replication Scope**:

   * Choose **To all DNS servers in this forest: <ForestName>**, then click **Next**.

6. **Forward Lookup Zone**:

   * Select **Forward lookup zone** and click **Next**.

7. **Zone Name**:

   * Enter **GlobalNames** as the zone name, then click **Next**.

8. **Dynamic Updates**:

   * Choose **Do not allow dynamic updates**, then click **Next**.

9. **Finish**:

   * Click **Finish** to complete the creation of the GlobalNames zone.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Creating the GlobalNames Zone Using Command Line** üíª

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Open an Elevated Command Prompt**:

   * Click **Start** ‚Üí **All Programs** ‚Üí **Accessories**, right-click **Command Prompt**, and choose **Run as administrator**.

2. **Run the Command**:

   * Type the following command and press **ENTER**:

   ```bash
   dnscmd <ServerName> /ZoneAdd GlobalNames /DsPrimary [/a <AdminEmail>] /DP /forest
   ```

   This will add the **GlobalNames** zone to your DNS configuration.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Creating the GlobalNames Zone Using PowerShell** ‚ö°

To configure the GlobalNames zone through PowerShell, you can use the following cmdlets:

* `Get-DnsServerGlobalNameZone`
* `Set-DnsServerGlobalNameZone`

These cmdlets provide a simple way to manage and configure the GlobalNames zone within your DNS environment.

## üìù **Deploying the GlobalNames Zone**

Once the GlobalNames zone is created, the next step is to **deploy** it and make it accessible throughout your network.

### **Key Deployment Steps:**

### Step 1: **Create the GlobalNames Zone**

The first step is to create the **GlobalNames zone** on a DNS server that is also a domain controller running **Windows Server 2008** or later.

* The GlobalNames zone is **not a special zone type** but a forward lookup zone with the name **GlobalNames**.
* Make sure it‚Äôs integrated with **Active Directory** for easier management and future scalability.

### Step 2: **Enable GlobalNames Zone Support**

The zone doesn‚Äôt provide name resolution until you explicitly enable support. Run the following command on every authoritative DNS server in the forest:

```bash
dnscmd <ServerName> /config /enableglobalnamessupport 1
```

Replace `<ServerName>` with the name or IP address of the DNS server hosting the GlobalNames zone.

### Step 3: **Replicate the GlobalNames Zone**

To ensure that the GlobalNames zone is available throughout the forest, replicate it to all DNS servers:

```bash
dnscmd <ServerName> /config /enableglobalnamessupport 1
```

You can limit the replication scope to specific servers by creating a **custom DNS application partition** for the GlobalNames zone.

### Step 4: **Populate the GlobalNames Zone**

For each server requiring single-label name resolution, add an **alias (CNAME) resource record** to the **GlobalNames zone**. You can do this via the DNS Manager interface or PowerShell.

### Step 5: **Publish the Location of the GlobalNames Zone**

To allow DNS clients in other forests to resolve names in the GlobalNames zone, add **SRV (Service Location) resource records** to the forest-wide DNS application partition.

Use the service name:
`_globalnames._msdcs` and specify the FQDN of the DNS server hosting the zone.

## ü§î **When Should You Deploy the GlobalNames Zone?**

The **GlobalNames zone** is useful in several scenarios:

* **Retiring WINS** or transitioning to IPv6, so DNS handles all name resolution.
* You need **single-label name resolution** for critical servers or websites (e.g., file servers, web servers).
* You cannot rely on **suffix search lists** for name resolution due to a large number of domains or a lack of centralized management.
* All DNS servers are running **Windows Server 2008** or later.

## üîë **Considerations and Best Practices**

1. **GlobalNames is Not a WINS Replacement**
   The GlobalNames zone **does not replace WINS** completely. It only helps with **static, globally important servers** that need single-label resolution.

2. **Static Records Only**
   The GlobalNames zone **supports static records**. **Dynamic updates** are not allowed, so only servers with static IP addresses and globally recognized names should be included.

3. **Active Directory Integration**
   We recommend **Active Directory** integration for the GlobalNames zone, as it simplifies management and enhances scalability.

4. **Scalability Issues**
   Do not rely on the GlobalNames zone for **dynamically registered records** or for managing records in large, complex networks.

---

## üõ† **PowerShell Cmdlets for Managing the GlobalNames Zone**

* **`Get-DnsServerGlobalNameZone`**: Retrieves the configuration of the GlobalNames zone.
* **`Set-DnsServerGlobalNameZone`**: Configures or modifies the GlobalNames zone settings.

These cmdlets make it easy to automate and configure GlobalNames across your network.

### üåç **Conclusion**

The **GlobalNames zone** is an effective way to manage single-label name resolution in environments transitioning away from WINS or needing IPv6 support. It allows **DNS** to handle important server names without relying on outdated technology, while simplifying management and increasing scalability.

Whether you choose to create the zone using the Windows interface, command line, or PowerShell, this setup will ensure that your environment can resolve names efficiently, keeping your network in the modern age of DNS-based name resolution.
